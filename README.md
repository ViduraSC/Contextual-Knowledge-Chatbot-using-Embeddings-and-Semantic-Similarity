# Knowledge Retrieval Chatbot

## Project Overview
The Knowledge Retrieval Chatbot is a state-of-the-art application designed to assist users by providing accurate information on various topics through natural language interactions. This project employs advanced techniques in **natural language processing** and **machine learning** to facilitate seamless communication.

## Techniques Used
- **Sentence Embeddings**: Utilizes the SentenceTransformer model to convert sentences into high-dimensional vectors for effective semantic understanding.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Implements cosine similarity to measure the similarity between user queries and documents in the knowledge base, ensuring accurate responses.
- **Flask Framework**: Employs Flask to create a web application that connects the front-end user interface with the back-end processing logic.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Develops a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance user experience.
